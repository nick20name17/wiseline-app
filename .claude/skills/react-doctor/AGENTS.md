# React Doctor

Run after making React changes to catch issues early. Use when reviewing code, finishing a feature, or fixing bugs in a React project.

Scans the React codebase for security, performance, correctness, and architecture issues. Outputs a 0-100 score with actionable diagnostics.

## Usage

```bash
bunx react-doctor . --verbose
```

## Workflow

Run after making changes to catch issues early. Fix errors first, then re-run to verify the score improved.
